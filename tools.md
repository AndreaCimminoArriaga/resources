## Tool 1:
- **Name of the tool**: Morph-CSV
- **Description**: Morph-CSV is an open source tool for querying tabular data sources using SPARQL. It exploits the information from the query, RML+FnO mappings and CSVW metadata to enhance the performance and completness of traditional OBDA systems (SPARQL-to-SQL translators). At this moment can be embebed in the top of any R2RML-compliant system.

- **Open source**: Yes
- **Year introduced**: 2019
- **Contact person**: David Chaves (dchaves@fi.upm.es)
- **Purpose**: Other (Enhance SPARQL-to-SQL engines when data is in CSV)
- **Mapping language**: YARRRML+FnO and CSVW
- **Supported data**: CSV (tested with BSBM 360K products)
- **Programming language**: Python + Bash
